# SchoolDeviceManagement
A device managment software made for school.

With the help of this software, students of our school should be able to borrow equipment (laptops, tablets, etc.).
It should be possible to scan the devices with a barcode and identify them with this barcode. Furthermore, there should be a GUI where further inputs can be made and a view of the available devices should be possible.
